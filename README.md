# shtalmausel-slider
Simple pure Vanilla JS slider v0.1.0 

Options: 
1. Speed for slider changes
2. Stop on mouse hover and continue on mouse leave 
3. Slider Dots that change slider image on click

- This is initial version, in the next versions I will add a options objects pattern for passing arguments into a functions, mobile touch/swipe support and change semantic to BEM methodology.
